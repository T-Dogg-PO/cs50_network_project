# cs50_network_project
Project number 4 for Harvard's CS50 web development course with Django. Involves creating a basic social media site

The full specifications for this project can be found here - https://cs50.harvard.edu/web/2020/projects/4/network/

As of now all of the specified functionality should have been implemented in my code. However, I am sure a variety of improvements can be made in terms of best design practices and efficiency. Not least of which include my JavaScript (which I am still new to) and my styling. However, I will be returning in the future to improve upon this project! Any suggestions for improvements would be much appreciated.
